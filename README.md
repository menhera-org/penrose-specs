Penrose: An experimental computing language research project

## What's this
Initially, this project is focued on Web usage.

The project aims to produce a compiler to WebAssembly (WASM) and JavaScript.

## Possible influences

- Rust
- Haskell
- TypeScript
- PureScript
- AssemblyScript
- Coq

## Project's aims

- Static typing
- _Everything is an expression_ philosophy
- Logical programming meets functional programming.
- Not necessarily Turing-complete. (Cannot write a non-terminating function.)
- Sane basis for logics and philosophy.
- Simply models computing process.

## Development

We explore various ideas and gradually integrate them.
